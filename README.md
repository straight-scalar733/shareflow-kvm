# ShareFlow

A software KVM that lets you share one keyboard and mouse across multiple PCs on your local network. Move your cursor to the edge of a screen and it seamlessly transitions to the next machine — no hardware switch required.

## Features

- **Edge switching** — push the cursor to any screen edge to move focus to the next machine
- **Directional gate** — only triggers when moving toward the edge, not during horizontal drags
- **Clipboard sync** — text and images transfer automatically between machines
- **File transfer** — drag and drop files across machines
- **LAN auto-discovery** — peers appear automatically, no IP configuration needed
- **TLS encrypted** — all traffic is encrypted with TOFU certificate pinning
- **Multi-monitor aware** — correctly maps cursor position across screens of different sizes
- **Hotkey return** — press Scroll Lock to snap back to local control
- **Windows + macOS** — Windows as primary controller, macOS as peer (Linux experimental)

## How It Works

### Discovery
On launch, each machine broadcasts a UDP announcement on port `24801` with a magic header (`SFLO`). Other machines on the same subnet listen for these broadcasts and surface discovered peers in the UI. Announcements are timestamped to prevent replay attacks and expire after 30 seconds.

### Connection
Once a peer is accepted, a TLS TCP connection is established. On first connect, the certificate fingerprint is stored (trust-on-first-use). Subsequent connections verify against the stored fingerprint. All messages are encoded as length-prefixed bincode frames.

### Focus & Edge Switching
Each machine tracks which machine currently has "focus" — the one receiving physical keyboard and mouse input.

When the cursor reaches the boundary of the local desktop:
1. **Edge detection** fires if the movement direction is predominantly toward the edge (45 degrees — prevents accidental triggers during near-edge drags)
2. A `SwitchFocus` message is sent to the target peer with the cursor entry coordinates
3. The sending machine **suppresses** all local input (cursor hidden, events blocked)
4. The receiving machine **injects** the cursor at the mapped entry point and begins injecting all forwarded events

Position is mapped proportionally between screens — crossing at 30% from the top on the sending screen places the cursor at 30% from the top on the receiving screen, regardless of resolution differences.

A 300ms cooldown prevents oscillation after any switch.

### Input Capture & Injection

**Windows (sender/primary):**
- Low-level `WH_MOUSE_LL` and `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hooks capture all input before it reaches applications
- Warp-to-center technique keeps the physical cursor stationary while computing virtual deltas
- Cursor is hidden via `ShowCursor` during remote control

**macOS (peer/receiver):**
- `CGEventTap` at `kCGHIDEventTap` captures input with full suppression capability
- Injection uses `CGWarpMouseCursorPosition` + `CGEventCreateMouseEvent` with both absolute position and relative delta fields set (required for apps that read deltas — window dragging, creative apps, 3D viewports)
- Modifier key state is tracked independently to prevent stuck modifiers across transitions

### Clipboard Sync
When focus switches to a remote machine, the local clipboard is pushed immediately so Ctrl+V works straight away on the remote machine. Both text and image clipboard content are supported.

### Protocol
All messages are serialised with bincode and framed with a 4-byte big-endian length prefix. Key message types:

| Message | Description |
|---|---|
| `Hello` / `HelloAck` | Handshake, exchanges peer ID, name, screen layout |
| `MouseMove` | Absolute cursor position |
| `MouseButton` | Button press/release |
| `MouseScroll` | Scroll delta |
| `Key` | Hardware scancode press/release |
| `SwitchFocus` | Trigger focus transition with entry coordinates |
| `ClipboardUpdate` | Clipboard content push |
| `FileStart/Chunk/Done` | Chunked file transfer |
| `Ping` / `Pong` | Keepalive (3 missed pongs closes the connection) |

## Building

### Prerequisites

**All platforms:**
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable, 1.77+)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (18+)

**Windows:**
- [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) (Desktop development with C++)
- [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) (included with Windows 11, installer available for Windows 10)
- [WiX Toolset v3](https://wixtoolset.org/) — required for .msi builds only

**macOS:**
- Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

---

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run in development

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### Build release installer

**Windows** (produces .msi and .exe installer):
```bash
npm run tauri build
```
Output: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/ShareFlow_x.x.x_x64_en-US.msi`

**macOS** (produces .dmg):
```bash
npm run tauri build
```
Output: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/ShareFlow_x.x.x_x64.dmg`

> macOS builds must be run on a Mac. Windows builds must be run on Windows. Cross-compilation is not supported.

---

### macOS — Accessibility Permission

On macOS, ShareFlow requires Accessibility permission to capture and inject input events.

1. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**
2. Add ShareFlow to the allowed list
3. Restart ShareFlow

Without this permission the event tap will fail silently and input will not be captured or injected.
